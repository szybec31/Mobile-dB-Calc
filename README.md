## dB-Calc:

Decibels are not a unit of measurement but a logarithmic representation of the ratio between two values of the same physical quantity.
The calculator allows you to convert units of watts (W) and volts (V) from a linear scale to a logarithmic scale, and vice versa.
The row of units range:
- [MW] to [pW/dBpW] 
- [dBMW] to [dBpW]
the same with volts
